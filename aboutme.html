    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student and an aspiring web developer with a strong interest in technology and digital innovation. Currently, my focus is on building a solid foundation in web development, with the aim of creating responsive and user-friendly websites in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond academics, I am passionate about sports, particularly basketball and volleyball, which have taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. I also enjoy playing online games, where I continuously sharpen my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a volunteer, I take pride in contributing to community efforts and supporting initiatives that promote growth and collaboration. I am committed to continuous learning and self-improvement, and I look forward to applying my skills and experiences to real-world projects and future opportunities in the tech industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to web development, I am also exploring other areas of technology such as graphic design, UI/UX, and basic programming in languages like JavaScript, Python, and C++. I enjoy experimenting with new tools and frameworks to enhance my creativity and problem-solving abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the future, I aspire to become a full-stack developer or a software engineer, working on projects that have a positive impact on people’s lives. I believe that technology has the power to inspire change, and I want to be part of that change by creating digital solutions that make everyday life easier and more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I’m not coding or studying, I love listening to music, watching tech-related videos, and spending time with my friends and family. I value balance—I believe that enjoying life’s simple moments is just as important as achieving professional goals.
